# scone-rl
Gym environments for biomechanics reinforcement learning research, using SCONE

## Prerequisits
In order to use scone-rl, you
* The latest version of SCONE (download [here](https://scone.software))
* Python 3.9

## Installation
To install scone-rl, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the scone-rl repository and type:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag will cause the package to directly use the code at the repository location, so that it automatically gets updated when you update the scone-rl repository. If you do not want that, leave out the `-e` option.

That's it! Try out the included example to get started.
