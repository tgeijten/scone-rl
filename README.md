# scone-rl
Gym environments designed for biomechanics reinforcement learning research.

## Prerequisits
Before using **scone-rl**, make sure the following is installed on your machine:
* The [latest version of SCONE](https://scone.software)
* Python 3.9

## Installation
To install **scone-rl**, navigate to the folder where you downloaded this repository and type:

```
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag will cause the package to directly use the code at the repository location, so that it automatically gets updated when you update the scone-rl repository. If you do not want that, leave out the `-e` option.

That's it! Try out the included example to get started.
